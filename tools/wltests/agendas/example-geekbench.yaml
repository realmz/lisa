# This is an example agenda which shows a possible (rather large) set of
# workloads and data collection.
#
# This will run 5 iterations each of a large set of workloads, under each of
# PELT and WALT load tracking (it assumes that the target supports both
# mechanisms).

global:
  # Collect energy data, ftrace files, and dmesg
  # You may want to edit your config.yaml to set up the energy_measurement
  # instrument (an example configuration is provided in this repo).
  instrumentation: [trace-cmd, dmesg]
  # Do everything 5 times
  iterations: 1

  # To aid reproducibility and try to reduce noise in power measurements,
  # minimise the screen brightness and set airplane mode on.
  # TODO: will this break workloads that require internet?
