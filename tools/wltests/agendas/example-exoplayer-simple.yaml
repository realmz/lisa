# This is an example of a simple agenda: It simply runs the exoplayer workload 3
# times. The workload parameters (such as video playback duration) are left to
# the workload's default, and target and instrumentation configuration will
# either be read from $LISA_HOME/tools/wltests/wa_user_directory/config.yaml or
# the defaults will be used.
global:
  # Collect energy data, ftrace files, and dmesg
  # You may want to edit your config.yaml to set up the energy_measurement
  # instrument (an example configuration is provided in this repo).
  instrumentation: [energy_measurement]

workloads:
  - name: exoplayer
    iterations: 3
